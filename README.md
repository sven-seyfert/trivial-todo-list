## trivial-todo-list

### Description

A trivial TODO list application written in AutoIt.

### Why

The main reason to implement this was a demo (livestream) to show "app-update-handler.au3" module, which allows you to update your current running application (executable) in case a new version exists.

### Showcase

How to easily embed the "app-update-handler.au3" module can be seen in "main.au3" (`_Main()` function).

### TODO

Redesign README.md file.
